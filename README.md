# Computer-System-Performance
Evaluation of Performance of Computer System that is represented as a closed network.
For a closed network modeling this computer system, it is necessary to determine
resource utilization, resource flows, the average number of jobs in each of the resources of this system, and response time of this system with a central server (average duration of one cycle, measured as time since the arrival of a job in the queue for the processor through the return branch of the processor until its
next passage through the return branch) for K from 2 to 8. These parameters are determined for the degree of multiprogramming of 10, 15, and 20. Determine the critical resource in the system
